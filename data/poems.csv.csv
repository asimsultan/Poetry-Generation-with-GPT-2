poem
"Roses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nSugar is sweet,\nAnd so are you."
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!"
"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,\nBut I have promises to keep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep."
"In the forest, through the trees,\nA gentle breeze whispers the leaves."
